# Testing Lottie Animations

## What We Fixed

1. **Created a new Stadium Goal Celebration component** (`/src/components/stadium-goal-celebration.tsx`)
   - Larger, stadium-specific animations
   - WAM branding colors (#B34AFF purple, #FFEE54 yellow)
   - Multiple Lottie animation fallbacks
   - Shows player image, name, team, rank, and assist info

2. **Updated the scoreboard** to use the new celebration component
   - Automatically triggers when a goal is scored
   - 6-second celebration duration
   - Console logging to debug Lottie loading

## How to Test

1. Open the scoreboard: `http://localhost:3001/scoreboard/04894c51-ebbf-4051-a0d1-3c87316a873e`

2. Open browser console (F12) and look for:
   - "Attempting to load Lottie animations for stadium celebration"
   - "Successfully loaded Lottie animation" (if it works)
   - "Failed to load animation from..." (if there are CORS issues)

3. Score a goal from the admin panel

4. The celebration should show:
   - Large "GOAL!" text with animation
   - Lottie animation in the background (if loaded)
   - Player info after 2 seconds
   - Falling soccer balls
   - WAM branding

## If Lottie Doesn't Load

The component has fallbacks:
- Still shows the celebration without Lottie
- Uses CSS animations for the text and soccer balls
- The celebration will still be visible and impressive
