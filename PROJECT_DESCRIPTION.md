# 8-a-side Cricket Tournament Management App

## Overview

The 8-a-side app is a web-based platform designed to manage a cricket tournament where 8 sponsor teams draft and trade players throughout the season. The application provides a comprehensive system for team management, player rankings, and a dynamic trading marketplace.

## Core Concept

### 1. Team Dashboard
Each sponsor team has their own dedicated dashboard where they can:

### 2. Player Ranking System
